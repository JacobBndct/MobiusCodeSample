This repo is contains samples of code intended for Mobius Digital's application process that I have written for Sleep Herd.

I've selected a broad range of different samples of code that are easy to understand outside of their original context to showcase the different breadth of my programming ability. 

The repo contains 3 snippets of code:
- Scene transition system
    - Showcases use of Unity's scriptable objects for easy tuning of parameters
- Cyclic queue data structure
    - Showcases uses of C#'s generics so that the data structure can be re-used for several different purposes
- Map exploration mechanic
    - Showcases use of compute shaders + bit packing using Uint's with bit wise operators
